# Calculator
This is a calculator project developed using JavaScript. It has the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, divsion, modulo, and negate.

------------
#### How I approached this project
1. I first created the UI on HTML and CSS - I used flexbox
2. Utilized data-* attribute on the HTML buttons for easy DOM manipulation
3. Created the operator functions
4. Created eventListeners for the buttons (numbers, operators, and equals)
5. Think of the logic on how to save the value of two numbers (first and second operands)
6. Created the functions and eventListeners for other buttons (CA, Del, decimal)
7. Implement #5
8. Thoroughly test the calculator and fixed found bugs

------------
#### Points for improvement
- Add keyboard support
- Add commas
- Refactor JavaScript code
- Improve the responsiveness

------------
#### Conclusion
Relative to my previous mini-projects which I was able to finish in a day or two, this Calculator suprisingly took me quite a lot of time. I had no issues on HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation, but for some reason, I had difficulty on how to structure the logic - specifically on saving the values of first and second operands. It was challenging, but definitely fun!
